# AU14-Job-Match-Agent
Ai Agent

What it does:

Upload your resume (PDF)

Paste a job description (or upload a text file)

Agent extracts skills & keywords, measures fit score, highlights gaps, suggests improvements, and (optionally) drafts a cover letter.

Works fully offline using spaCy + regex + TF-IDF. If you add an OpenAI key, it upgrades the copywriting.
